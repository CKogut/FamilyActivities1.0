      My name is Corinne and this is my passion project for
      <a href="https://zipcodewilmington.com/" target="_blank"> ZipCode Wilmington</a>. This project is the intersection of three different
      roles in my life. Those roles are a data engineering student, a mom and a late-diagnosed ADHDer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to build something I wish existed, a tool to make organizing family fun easier. I find organizing activities to be a bit of
      a personal mountain to climb.

      One aspect of ADHD is "out of sight, out of mind". It's easy to forget what games we have hidden away in closets, or how much we enjoy
      visiting a museum. It's easy to get stuck in routines, and I wanted an application that will prompt me with ideas and allow me to
      browse ideas that meet certain criteria. For example, indoor activities for a rainy day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future functionality will include having the weather displayed in the app so there's no need to click away. Clicking away with ADHD
      can lead to a 20-minute minimum wormhole of lost time. I also want the application to add activities to my calendar, as well as send
      texts to friends inviting them to join.
