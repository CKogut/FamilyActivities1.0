Passion Project: "Family Activities App"

"Family Activities App" is a web app that helps a user pick a family activity. At the top of the app will be a
“quick suggestion” button which will suggest a random activity. The weather will be displayed to help the user decide
if they want to pursue the activity or ask for another suggestion.

If the user would like a more tailored selection, below the quick suggest button will be drop down selections to select
the number of participants, desired cost, amount of time, and location of the activity.

Users can create a profile which will allow them to favorite activities, as well as mark a suggestion to not be shown
again. They will also be able to add their own activities.

Future additions include being able to add events to the user's chosen calendar app, and to send automated invites to
friends and family to join!
